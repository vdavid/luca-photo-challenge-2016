This is a pet project I created for my sister.

It's a very basic PHP/Laravel project that automatically releases a new
photo challenge each week (UPDATE: modified to biweekly) and shows all past
photo challenges on a simple page.

The content is hard-coded into blade templates and as my sister does not speak
a very good English, the content is in Hungarian (sorry).
